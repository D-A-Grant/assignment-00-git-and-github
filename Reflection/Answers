### Question 1
## To find a more useful purpose for the website we would have to understand what will make the most sense
for a historian. The more info placed on the cards the better but adding to much info would make the
webpage cluttered with things that may not be important. There is a delicate balance between enough info
and too much info for someone wanting to study the separated. Other fields that would be of interest to a historian
would be date of birth, occupation, and major but this information might be a bit more sensitive for inclusion
on the pubic website.

### Question 2
## It seems as though there would be quite a few limitations with the format that has been selected. All
all of the info was casually entered. The categories listed above would give a historian a view into the
age of the students interested in this material and to see if the students taking the course are from
the sciences or the arts.
